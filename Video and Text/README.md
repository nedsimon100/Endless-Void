# Endless Void
 The second theme for my Game a Week assignment at university


all sounds were voice acted by me and then distorted and slowed down using audacity.

controlls:

arrow keys to move
space bar for sonar
left click to draw map

still contains some bugs

cool things:

used perlin noise to build a precedural cave system and checks the map that the player draws to give them a score.

used partical system as only way to see around the map so the player has a general idea of where they are without ever seeing everything.

the partical system that the player uses to see attracts nearby enemies to encourage risk vs reward with moving in the dark and escaping enemies.
